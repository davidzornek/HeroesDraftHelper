# HeroesDraftHelper
This is the location of the actual web app.

For now, this has to be run via a local webserver instead of accessing the files directly.

One easy option is from the HeroesDraftHelper directory, run
```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```
and then open http://localhost:8000/helper/helper.html

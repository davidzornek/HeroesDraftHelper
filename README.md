# HeroesDraftHelper
Data-driven Draft Helper for Heroes of the Storm.

The idea is to build a draft helper than can be used as a local web app that takes into account as much data as possible.

For now, the data will need to be collected and stored into a separate file (or files) then linked from the web app.
